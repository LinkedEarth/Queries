    "# Searching the LinkedEarth wiki: Guide to SPARQL queries\n",
    "\n",
    "One the main advantages of the LinkedEarth Ontology is in its ability to search for the datasets using very specific criteria. For intance, it is possible to search all the sea surface temperature datasets covering the Holocene from a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one would break down the query into simpler pieces, this is what they would need to look for.\n",
    "1. The archive is \"marine sediment\"\n",
    "2. The type of inferred variables are \"sea surface temperature\" and \"age\" (To look for the Holocene)\n",
    "3. The InferredVariableType \"age\" needs to have a HasMinValue of 0 and a HasMAxValue of 10 (kyr) or 10000 (yr).\n",
    "4. The dataset needs to be between specified \"lat\" and \"lon\" coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've just thrown a lot of terms into this query that you may not be familiar with. If you want to know more about how the LinkedEarth database is organized and makes use of the LinkedEarth Ontology, visit [this page](http://wiki.linked.earth/LinkedEarth_Ontology).\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibilities to query the database are endless; however, it requires knowlegde of the LinkedEarth Ontology and the SPARQL language. We understand that not every use need to form highly complex query. This Notebook is for you! We have identified several types of queries that are often performed and created a user-friendly (no knowledge of SPARQL required) way for you to enter specific search criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to LinkedEarth, read all the sections below. If you've already performed queries and are familiar with the database, skip to the last section.\n",

    "\n",
    "This Notebook is intended for user with very little to no knowledge of SPAQRL and Python. It will help you create a text file for the query and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to know a little bit more about the LinkedEarth wiki and name standardization. Let's assume you want to look for \"marine sediment\" with the proxy \"d18O\". Two things need to happen: (1) The wiki needs to understand what a proxy is and (2) it needs to search for the exact character match (i.e. d18O rathern than delta18O, delta-18O...).\n",
    "\n",
    "We taught the wiki that a \"climate proxy\" is in fact composed of a Proxy Archive (e.g., marine sediment), a Proxy Sensor (e.g. Globigerinoides ruber), and a Proxy Observation (e.g. d18O) following the work of [Evans et al. (2013)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113002011).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for standardizing the terms, we are in the process of doing so with input from the community. To see what observations, archives and sensors are already available on the wiki, we essentially created a query to ask it just that! The results are in the cells below (rerun them to have the most up-to-date snapshot of possibilities). All you have to do is then make sure that your query term follows the wiki nomenclature (i.e. query for D18O rather than d18O!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you will need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your computer and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org). Both come standard with the [Anaconda release](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). This Notebook was written as to minimize user inputs. In other words, you do not need to have extensive knowledge of Python to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in learning more about Jupyter Notebook, check out this [demo](https://github.com/nickmckay/LiPD-utilities/blob/master/Examples/Welcome%20Jupyter%20-%20Quickstart.ipynb). \n",

    "## <a name=ontology></a> Introduction to the LinkedEarth Ontology\n",
    "\n",
    "At its most fundamental level, the LinkedEarth ontology allows to not only define terms commonly used to describing a paleoclimate dataset (e.g. variable, uncertainty, calibration) but also to specify the relationship among those terms (e.g. a variable has uncertainty). As such it allows us to male inferences, support complex queries, as well as perform quality control on the data. To learn more about the LinkedEarth ontology, visit [this page](http://wiki.linked.earth/LinkedEarth_Ontology).\n",
    "\n",
    "The LinkedEarth Ontology is divided into several components: the [LiPD ontology](#LiPD), the [Proxy Archive Ontology](#proxyarchive), the [Proxy Observation Ontology](#proxyobs), the [Proxy Sensor Ontology](#proxysensor), the [Instrument Ontology](#instrument), and the [Inferred Variable Ontology](#inferredvariable).\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=LiPD></a> The LiPD Ontology\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the ontology concerns itseld with the formatting of a dataset and follows the [LiPD](http://wiki.linked.earth/Linked_Paleo_Data) format very closely. Although performing a query on the terms included in this part of the ontology would be extremely rare (but not impossible), the terms are used to navigate the hierarchical struture of the wiki. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=proxyarchive></a> The Proxy Archive Ontology\n",
    "\n",
    "This ontology defines the different categories of archive types used in paleoclimate studies (such as marine sediment, coral,...) follwing the definition by [Evans et al. (2013)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113002011).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the wiki, the type of archive can be specified at two levels:\n",
    "1. As a top dataset property using the \"archiveType\" property from LiPD\n",
    "2. As part of the proxy system which is formally mapped in the ontology\n",
    "\n",
    "Because some datasets may only contain one of the two possible ways to refer to the archiveType property, we strongly suggest that you enter all possible combinations when performing the search. For instance, search for both \"marine sediment\" (the LiPD term) or \"MarineSediment\" (the LinkedEarth Ontology term).\n",
